      HTML5 is the fifth revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
      standard. It was released in 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
      with the aim of improving the language and addressing the need for better
      support for multimedia content on the web. HTML5 comes with a host of new
      features and capabilities that make it an excellent choice for building
      modern, interactive, and engaging web applications.
    </p>

      One of the significant improvements of HTML5 is its enhanced support for
      multimedia content such as audio and video. The language includes new
      elements such as audio and video that allow developers to embed audio and
      video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party
      plugins like Flash. Additionally, HTML5 provides the ability to manipulate
      and interact with multimedia content using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraf">
      HTML5 also offers better support for mobile devices with its mobile-first
      approach. The language includes features like responsive design, which
      enables web pages to adapt and render correctly on devices of different
      screen sizes. Other mobile-friendly features include geolocation, which
      allows websites to access the user's location, and touch input support.
